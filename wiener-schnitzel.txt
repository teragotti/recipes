ingredients for 4 persons
8 pieces Veal cutlets (90g each)
4 pieces Eggs
200 g Bread crumbs (very fine)
100 g Flour (fine)
300 ml Butter
100 g Vegetable oil (or peanut oil)
Salt
Lemon slices (and fried parsley for garnish)

Tenderize the veal to about 2–4mm, and salt on both sides. On a flat plate, stir the eggs briefly with a fork. 
(The egg becomes too thin if you beat it too much). Lightly coat the cutlets in flour then dip into the egg, 
and finally, coat in breadcrumbs. Heat the butter and oil in a large pan (allow the fat to get very hot) 
and fry the schnitzels until golden brown on both sides. Make sure to toss the pan regularly
so that the schnitzels are surrounded by oil and the crumbing becomes ‘fluffy’. 
Remove, and drain on kitchen paper. Fry the parsley in the remaining oil and drain. 
Place the schnitzels on awarmed plate and serve garnishedwith parsley and slices of lemon.

Tipp
Make sure to use high-quality, very fine breadcrumbs. Genuine Wiener schnitzels need to be fried in a frying pan, 
not in a deep fryer. Also, the use of butter is essential to give the schnitzels a typical ‘nutty’ taste.
